A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system in Python. This implementation includes all the core components of a RAG system:

Document Chunking: Breaks documents into smaller, manageable pieces with some overlap to maintain context
Embedding: Creates vector representations of text (simplified for demonstration)
Vector Storage: Stores document chunks and their embeddings for retrieval
Retrieval: Finds relevant documents based on query similarity
Generation: Creates responses based on the query and retrieved documents

This code demonstrates the RAG workflow:

Documents are ingested, chunked, and stored as vectors
When a query comes in, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks
The retrieved context is used alongside the query to generate a response

Some important notes about this implementation:

The embedding function is extremely simplified - in a real-world scenario, you'd use a proper embedding model like OpenAI's text embeddings or SentenceTransformers
The generator is just a template - you'd typically connect this to an actual LLM like OpenAI's GPT or a local model
The vector store is in-memory only - production systems use vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS
