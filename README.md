# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – From Basics to Advanced

Welcome to the **RAG Teaching Repository**!
This project walks you through the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from scratch, starting with simple concepts and building toward a full-fledged, production-ready RAG pipeline. It's designed specifically for **educational purposes** — ideal for learners, researchers, and practitioners who want to understand RAG thoroughly.

## 📚 What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a hybrid approach that combines:

* **Information Retrieval (IR)**: to fetch relevant documents from a knowledge base.
* **Generative Language Models (LMs)**: to produce context-aware responses based on retrieved documents.

This helps bridge the gap between static knowledge and dynamic answering.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Teach RAG step-by-step, from basic to advanced.
* Implement all components: indexing, retrieval, generation, ranking, and feedback loop.
* Introduce multiple retrieval methods (sparse/dense).
* Showcase integration with vector databases and LLM frameworks.
* Build awareness of real-world challenges like hallucinations, latency, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features Covered

* ✅ Traditional and dense retrieval (TF-IDF, sentence-transformers)
* ✅ Vector search with FAISS / Chroma / Pinecone
* ✅ Prompt engineering for generation
* ✅ Chain-of-thought prompting with retrieval context
* ✅ LangChain and HuggingFace pipelines
* ✅ Reranking with cross-encoders
* ✅ Evaluation metrics for RAG (precision, recall, etc.)
* ✅ User feedback loop and continuous improvement
